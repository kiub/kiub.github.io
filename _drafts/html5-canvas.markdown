title: HTML5 canvas
---

The canvas element provides scripts with a resolution-dependent bitmap canvas, which can be used for rendering graphs, game graphics, art, or other visual images on the fly.

> The canvas has been designed for pixel-based graphics, while SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics, another W3C standard) is for vector-based graphics.
